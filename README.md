# dolphin

Inspired by [Sam Ritchie](https://github.com/sritchie)'s [functional numerical methods](https://samritchie.io/functional-numerical-methods/), I wanted to contribute a small example from control theory: the kalman filter.  This example is originally care of [Patrick Martin](https://github.com/drpjm/kalman-filter), and I will be working to extend the API, test cases, and documentation.
